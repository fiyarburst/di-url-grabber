```
01:44 < fiyarburst> so i finally got around to this script
01:45 < fiyarburst> https://github.com/fiyarburst/di-url-grabber/
01:45 < Bator> Title: fiyarburst/di-url-grabber Â· GitHub (at github.com)
01:46 < fiyarburst> the idea is, using python 2.7, run 'python pydi.py --key your_listener_key_here premium house' and it'll return you all the premium urls 
                    with 'house' in the name
01:46 < fiyarburst> with your key attached for quick copy pasting into your player
01:46 < fiyarburst> and then it'll remember the key and cache the list of playlists for next time
01:47 < fiyarburst> nothing groundbreaking but it saves me a few clicks every time i want to find something new to listen to
01:48 < fiyarburst> so i can just go 'python pydi.py premium step' to quickly check out what "club dubstep" is
```
<em>it wasn't worth it so i used 'python pydi.py premium tech' instead</em>
